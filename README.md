Few Scripts for ChannelFinderService

## WIP

For my testing, I cannot use the `mapping_definitions.sh` file due to the different Elasticsearch version in Debian 10 according to [1]

https://github.com/ChannelFinder/ChannelFinderService/blob/master/channelfinder/src/main/resources/mapping_definitions.sh

It works, but only for Elasticsearch point of view. Channel Finder needs additional steps for up-to-date Elasticsearch.
